# Catulator

A cat turned into a calculator.

It provides basic calculator functionality, but with the laziness that can be expected from a cat. It will require treats to get it to work and will demand that it be petted after doing 3 calculations.

The calculator allows commands to be entered using the keyboard. To execute your calculation, either press on the unicorn cat, press Enter or press the equals key.

Meow away!!!
